# Martin Bednář
*Software Engineer*

**I turn business ideas into custom software solutions.**

I'm a full-stack software engineer focused on building custom software and web applications that solve real-world problems. My favorite work lies in translating complex business needs into simple, powerful, and effective technical solutions.

As an independent software engineer, I'm contributing to the development of several projects:

 - [Sportera](https://sportera.cz/), a platform that maps public sports facilities,
 - [decathlon.cz](https://decathlon.cz/), an e-commerce platform for sports equipment,
 - and an internal platform dedicated to business process optimization at [Decathlon CZ - Sustainability](https://www.decathlon.cz/SDblog_lp-7UOV4P).
